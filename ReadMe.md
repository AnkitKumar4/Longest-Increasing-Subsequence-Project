# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction: -
Longest Increasing Subsequence: -
The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

## Problem statement: -
As a developer, write a Java code to find the longest increasing subsequence from a list of random numbers.
Project objective: -
As a developer, write a program to find the longest increasing subsequence.

## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10
•	language Used: - Java
•	Platform: - Eclipse
•	Tools: - Git, GitHub 
## Terms and Concepts: - 
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.
## Core java concepts:
 -variables
 -data types
-operators
-type casting
-class
- objects 
-access specifiers
## Other programming Concepts: -
Control Statement: - (if, else, else if)
Core Keywords: -
-This 
- final 
-Static 


## Feasibility study: -
- Technical analysis
-Economic Analysis
-performance Analysis

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.
Strength - in which user can find the longest increasing subsequence from a list
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data
Opportunity- we can search n numbers of elements where n<100
Thread - without proper data we can't search the data. if condition is n>100

## Conclusion: -
In this we can find the longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
